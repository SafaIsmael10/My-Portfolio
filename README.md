# My-Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. Below are all the projects I've worked on:

- [MedKit Medical Website](./MedKit): This was my final year project in university where I made a website with an appointment booking side for patients and an appointment management side for doctors. It uses PHP, HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
- [Football Team Outliner App](./Outliner): This is an outliner app made with Java which has a hierarchal structure that the user can manipulate in order to organise their 5-a-side football team with its players.
- [Study Sessions App](./StudySessionsApp): This CRUD style app was made using React to allow students to create a new study session which contains information on the subject, time, etc. which other students can join/leave.
